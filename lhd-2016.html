<p>HealthyText is a text-messaging service that checks in with your health goals. Set up text alerts that ask you whether or not you have completed your goals that day, generate graphs summarizing your progress, and send updates to your doctor.</p>

<p>With HealthyText, you can text your health-related check-in question to the HealthyText phone number to set up text notifications. When you receive the daily texts, respond to the questions appropriately (as shown in the image below). HealthyTexts saves your data and generates visualizations of your progress, both for your own use and to show your doctor.</p>
