<p>
I'm a Data Science Analyst with <a href="http://www.pewresearch.org/">Pew Research Center's</a> Data Labs team.  Outside of work, I sometimes volunteer as a project manager with <a href="https://www.solveforgood.org/">DSSG Solve</a> and am previously have worked with <a href="https://www.illinoislegalaid.org/20years/spotlight-DSSGvols">ILAO</a>. I also occasionally volunteer at the <a href="https://www.usbg.gov/">US Botanic Garden</a>.
</p> 

<p>I graduated from <a href="http://www.swarthmore.edu/">Swarthmore College</a> (near Philadelphia) with a double major in computer science and math with statistics emphasis.
I was also a <a href = "https://dssg.uchicago.edu/">Data Science for Social Good</a> fellow in Chicago in 2018.
Previously, I worked with the <a href="https://analystinstitute.org/">Analyst Institute</a>, a progressive analytics group in DC. </p>
    
<p>At Swarthmore, I worked for the <a href="http://www.swarthmore.edu/its">IT</a>, math, and computer science departments, in addition to being heavily involved with groups for students underrepresented in STEM fields. I assisted in the research of Dr. Kelly McConville by building <a href="http://52.22.110.202:3838/eremy1/minimalvolcano/">interactive graphics with R Shiny</a> and (separately) <a href="https://emilygasser.wordpress.com/">Dr. Emily Gasser</a> by traveling to Manokwari, West Papua, Indonesia and collecting data on Wooi, a mostly undocumented language spoken by around 200 people living on Yapen Island. 
I also helped create and organize <a href = "{{ site.baseurl }}/peripeteia/">a large-scale celebration of interdisciplinary learning</a> and <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/lhd-2016.html">won a local hackathon</a>.
